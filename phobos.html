                        Phobos is the largest and closest moon of Mars. It is a small, irregularly shaped body with a diameter of about 22 kilometers. It orbits Mars at an altitude of about 6,000 kilometers, which is less than one-tenth the distance of the Moon from Earth.<br>
                        The surface of Phobos is covered with craters and very porous, with a density of only about 1.8 grams per cubic centimeter. This suggests that this moon is made up of a mixture of rock and ice. Phobos is slowly spiraling inward towards Mars, and it is estimated that it will eventually crash into the planet in about 50 million years.<br>

                        Phobos is named after the Greek god of fear.
                        Phobos is the only moon in the solar system that orbits its planet within its Roche limit, which is the distance at which a satellite would be torn apart by the tidal forces of its planet.
                        Phobos is thought to be a captured asteroid or comet.<br>
                        Several missions to Phobos are planned or proposed. The European Space Agency's ExoMars rover, which is scheduled to launch in 2024, will include a lander that will touch down on Phobos. The Chinese space agency is also planning a mission to Phobos, which is scheduled to launch in 2028.
